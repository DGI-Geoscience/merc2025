### Questions

1. Identify visible data error points in the physical properties by listing the parameter and depth these
errors occur at. How can we easily correct these erroneous data points? (7 marks)

2. What are the differences in the Natural Gamma log and Natural Gamma Repeat log? (2 marks)

3. Identify differences and similarities between the purple, red and darkest brown and lightest brown units with regards to the physical properties? (5 marks)

4. At the top of the borehole it appears that the lithological rock type logged by the geologist is incorrect. Please indicate why this might be.  (3 marks)

5. Within the last purple unit, can you identify two or more sub-units based on the physical properties. Please explain how you came up with this answer. (3 marks)
